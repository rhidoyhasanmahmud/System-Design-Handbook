# How Tables and Indexes Are Stored on Disk

1. Tables (Heap Files or Organized Files)

A table in a database is stored as a collection of rows (records), and they are typically stored on disk in pages (blocks).

Each row = a record
Each page = a chunk of data (like 8KB)

Types of Table Storage:
- Heap file: Rows are stored in no particular order.
- Clustered/Sorted file: Rows are stored based on the order of one column (e.g., by id).

Example:

A table:

| ID | Name  | Age |
|----|-------|-----|
| 1  | Alice | 23  |
| 2  | Bob   | 25  |
| 3  | Zara  | 21  |

These records will be stored in data pages, like:

```pgsql
Page 1:
+---------------------+
| Record: ID=1        |
| Record: ID=2        |
| Record: ID=3        |
+---------------------+
```

Each page has:

- Header (metadata)
- Multiple rows
- Free space for new inserts (if available)

2. Indexes

An index is like a table of contents in a book. It helps you find data fast without scanning the whole table.

Most common: B-Tree Index

Suppose you create this index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON users(name);
```
This creates a tree structure like:

```css
        [K]
      /     \
   [A-C]   [L-Z]
```

So if you're looking for Zara, DB directly goes to [L-Z] node instead of reading all users.

‚úÖ Index stores column value + pointer to the actual row.

# How Tables and Indexes Are Queried

Without Index:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Zara';
```

üîÅ DB scans the whole table (called Full Table Scan)
‚õî Slow if table has millions of rows.

With Index:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Zara';
```

‚úÖ DB uses the index tree, finds the pointer, and jumps directly to the data row.
üí° Much faster ‚Äì no need to scan entire table.

## What is a Heap File?

A Heap File is the simplest way to store data in a database table:

- Rows are stored in the order they are inserted.
- No sorting, no structure ‚Äî just a pile of rows.

Characteristics:

- Fast insert
- No order
- Slower search (needs to check every row unless indexed)

Real-life Analogy:

Like throwing all your documents in a drawer - to find one, you may need to go through all of them.

Example:

Insert 3 rows:

```sql
INSERT INTO users VALUES (3, 'Zara', 21);
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice', 23);
INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, 'Bob', 25);
```
In a heap file, rows might be stored like:

```yaml
Page 1:
- Row 1: Zara
- Row 2: Alice
- Row 3: Bob
```
They‚Äôre not sorted by ID or name.

## What is an Organized (Sorted/Clustered) File?

An Organized File stores data sorted by a key column (like id, name, etc.).
This structure is also called a clustered index when used in many RDBMS (e.g., MySQL InnoDB).

Characteristics:
- Rows stored in order based on key
- Faster range queries (e.g., WHERE id BETWEEN 10 AND 20)
- Slower insert/update (needs to maintain order)

Real-life Analogy:

Like storing your documents in alphabetically sorted folders ‚Äî easy to find and range-search.

Example: Same rows, but stored by ID:

```yaml
Page 1:
- Row 1: Alice (ID 1)
- Row 2: Bob (ID 2)
- Row 3: Zara (ID 3)
```

Now, searching WHERE id = 2 or WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 2 is faster.

## Key Differences

| Feature           | Heap File                          | Organized File (Clustered)               |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Storage Order     | Random (insertion order)           | Sorted by one column (e.g., ID)          |
| Insert Speed      | Fast                               | Slower (due to sorting)                  |
| Read/Search Speed | Slow (unless indexed)              | Fast for range queries                   |
| Use Case          | OLTP apps (lots of writes)         | Reporting apps (lots of reads)           |

## When to Use What?

- Heap File: Good when you mostly insert data and don‚Äôt care about order.
E.g., logging systems, message queues, temporary staging tables.
- Organized File: Best when you frequently read/search in sorted order.
E.g., analytics dashboards, bank ledgers, sorted reports.

## Full Flow Example

Table: users

| ID | Name  | Age |
|----|-------|-----|
| 1  | Alice | 23  |
| 2  | Bob   | 25  |
| 3  | Zara  | 21  |

We‚Äôll now follow two flows:

Flow 1: Without Index (Full Table Scan)

Goal: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Zara';

1. Query hits DB engine
2. DB planner checks: ‚ùå No index available on name
3. DB opens the table file on disk (divided into pages)
4. Reads Page 1 ‚Üí checks each row:
- Row 1 ‚Üí name = Alice ‚Üí skip
- Row 2 ‚Üí name = Bob ‚Üí skip
- Row 3 ‚Üí name = Zara ‚Üí ‚úÖ match!

5. Return row to the user

Time: Slow for large tables

Disk: Reads every row = I/O heavy

Flow 2: With Index on name (B-Tree)

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON users(name);
```

Goal: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Zara';

1. Query hits DB engine
2. DB planner finds: ‚úÖ Index available on name
3. Navigates B-Tree Index:
- Root ‚Üí goes to leaf where Zara might be
4. Finds entry:
```pgsql
Zara ‚Üí points to Row 3 (in page X)
```
5. DB jumps directly to Page X, Row 3
6. Returns row to the user

Time: Fast

Disk: Reads only 2 things:

- Part of the index
- Actual row in data file

# Table Storage Flow (Behind the Scenes)

When you insert:

```sql
INSERT INTO users VALUES (4, 'John', 26);
```
DB does:

1. Finds a data page with free space (or creates new page)
2. Adds Row 4 inside that page
3. Updates index (if any):
- Adds 'John' ‚Üí Page Y, Row 2 to B-tree

## Data File (Disk)

```yaml
Page 1:
  - Row 1: Alice
  - Row 2: Bob
  - Row 3: Zara

Page 2:
  - Row 4: John
```
## Index (B-Tree)

```less
        [M]
       /   \
   [A-F]   [N-Z]
    |        |
  Alice     Zara ‚Üí Page 1, Row 3  
  Bob       John ‚Üí Page 2, Row 1
```

## Summary Flow Chart

```text
       Query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Zara';
                            |

Full table scan                        Use B-Tree or Hash Index
  |                                             |
Check every row                          Go to Index Node
  |                                             |
Find Zara in row                          Jump to Disk Location
  |                                             |
Return result                              Return result

### Summary 

1. Table 

- A table is a logical collection of rows and columns.
- Physically, it's stored on disk as blocks/pages.
- Each row = one record (e.g., one user, one order).

2. Row_ID

- A unique identifier used internally by the database.
- Helps the database locate a specific row on disk.
- In some systems (like Oracle), RowID = block address + row offset.

3. Page

- Data on disk is stored in fixed-size chunks called pages (usually 4KB or 8KB).
- Each page contains multiple rows.
- Read/write always happens page-by-page, not row-by-row.

Example: If a page = 8KB, and each row = 1KB ‚Üí one page stores 8 rows.

4. IO (Input/Output)

- Refers to reading/writing from disk.
- Disk IO is slow, so databases try to:
  - Use indexes to avoid full scans
  - Cache hot pages in memory (buffer pool)

5. Heap Data Structure
- Rows are stored unordered in the table.
- New rows are placed wherever there is free space.
- This is the default in many databases.

Advantage: Fast inserts

Disadvantage: Slower lookups (unless indexed)

6. Index Data Structure: B-Tree

- A balanced tree structure used to speed up lookups.
- Each node contains a range of values and pointers to child nodes or data.
- Helps DB jump directly to relevant data.

Example:
- Query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = 'Zara';
- Without index: full table scan
- With B-Tree: search tree ‚Üí get Row ID ‚Üí jump to page

7. Example of a Query Flow

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 101;
```

Without Index:
- DB checks every page ‚Üí every row ‚Üí match found
- Slower, especially on large tables

With B-Tree Index on id:
- DB looks in B-Tree ‚Üí finds pointer to page
- Reads page directly ‚Üí fetches row
- Much faster (fewer disk I/Os)

# Primary Key & Secondary (or Alternate/Secondary Index) Key

## ‚úÖ Basic Difference

| Feature         | Primary Key                    | Secondary Key (Secondary Index)          |
|----------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Uniqueness     | Must be unique                  | Can be unique or non-unique               |
| Null Allowed   | ‚ùå Not allowed                  | ‚úÖ Allowed (if not unique)                |
| Default Index  | ‚úÖ Automatically indexed        | ‚ùå Needs to be created manually           |
| One per table  | ‚úÖ Only one                     | ‚úÖ Can have multiple                      |

1. Primary Key Affects Physical Row Location (Clustered Index)

In many DB engines (e.g., MySQL InnoDB), the primary key is clustered ‚Äî meaning:

- The actual data is stored sorted by the primary key.
- Other indexes point to the primary key value, not to the row directly.

So choosing a poor primary key (like UUID) can harm performance.

2. Secondary Indexes Use the Primary Key as a Pointer

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255),
  age INT
);

CREATE INDEX idx_email ON users(email);
```
Now, when you query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'abc@example.com';
```
- The secondary index on email finds the matching row.
- But it doesn't store full row ‚Üí it stores a pointer to the primary key (id)
- Then a second lookup is done to get the row via id.

This is called a "double lookup" ‚Äì and it‚Äôs slower than accessing via primary key.

3. Updating Secondary Indexed Columns Is Costly

If a column has a secondary index and you UPDATE it:
- The DB must remove the old index entry
- Then insert the new index entry

Performance hit especially on frequent updates.

4. Secondary Indexes Can Be Covering Indexes

You can design secondary indexes to include extra columns:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_email_age ON users(email) INCLUDE (age);
```
Now, queries like:
```sql
SELECT age FROM users WHERE email = 'x';
```
Can be answered directly from the index (no row lookup needed).

5. NULL in Secondary Indexes
- Secondary indexes can index NULL values (unless set otherwise).
- Primary keys can never be NULL.

## Summary

| Feature                   | Primary Key                         | Secondary Key                            |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Must be Unique            | ‚úÖ Yes                               | ‚ùå Not always                              |
| Allows NULL               | ‚ùå Never                             | ‚úÖ Yes                                     |
| Auto-Indexed              | ‚úÖ Yes                               | ‚ùå No (manual)                             |
| Affects Physical Row Order| ‚úÖ Often (clustered)                 | ‚ùå No                                      |
| Lookup Speed              | ‚úÖ Fast (no indirection)             | ‚ùå Needs extra step via primary key        |

# Database Pages

A page is the smallest unit of data storage and I/O in a database system.

- Typically fixed size: 4 KB, 8 KB, or 16 KB (depends on DB engine like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle)
- A table‚Äôs rows are stored inside pages.
- When data is read/written, entire pages are loaded into memory, not individual rows.

Real-Life Analogy

Think of a notebook:
- Each page can contain multiple notes (rows)
- You can‚Äôt tear off just one word ‚Äî you flip the whole page

A page usually contains:

```sql
+---------------------+
| Page Header         |  ‚Üê Metadata (page ID, free space, checksums)
+---------------------+
| Row 1               |
| Row 2               |
| ...                 |
+---------------------+
| Free Space          |  ‚Üê For inserts or updates
+---------------------+
| Row Directory       |  ‚Üê Offsets pointing to row positions
+---------------------+
```

### How Rows Are Stored in Pages

```sql 
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  age INT
);
```
You insert 3 rows:

```sql
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'Alice', 23);
INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, 'Bob', 25);
INSERT INTO users VALUES (3, 'Zara', 21);
```
These rows are stored inside a page, like:

```pgsql
Page 1:
 - Row 1: id=1, name=Alice, age=23
 - Row 2: id=2, name=Bob, age=25
 - Row 3: id=3, name=Zara, age=21
```
If a page has space for 100 rows and you insert more than that, a new page is allocated.

### Why Pages Matter

1. Efficient I/O
- Instead of reading row-by-row, DB loads one page into memory ‚Äî way faster.

2. Index Navigation
- Indexes point to pages + row offset, not the raw file location.

3. Update Strategy
- If a row grows too large (e.g., you update a TEXT column), the DB might:
  - Move it to a new page
  - Leave a pointer in the original page (called row forwarding)

## Page Types and What They Store

| Page Type       | Used For                                      | Example Data Stored                                      |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Page        | Storing table rows (tuples)                  | `id=1, name='Alice', age=23`                             |
| Index Page       | Storing B-Tree or Hash index entries         | `name='Alice' ‚Üí pointer to data row`                     |
| LOB Page         | Storing Large Objects (TEXT, BLOB, etc.)     | Large documents, images, long descriptions               |
| Undo Page        | Stores *before-image* of data for rollback   | Old value: `balance=500` before update                   |
| Redo/Log Page    | Write-Ahead Log (WAL) for crash recovery     | `"Row 3 was updated"` ‚Äî can be replayed                  |
| Header Page      | Metadata about the table or segment          | Page count, row format, next pointers                    |
| Free Page        | Empty or reusable space                      | Available for new inserts                                |
| System Page      | Stores system-level info (transactions, etc.)| Transaction ID, page map, metadata                        |

## Detailed View by Data Type

| Data Type               | Stored In             | Notes                                               |
|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `INT`, `VARCHAR(50)`     | Data Page              | Stored inline unless large                          |
| `TEXT`, `BLOB`           | LOB Page               | Stored separately; main page stores pointer         |
| `JSON`, `XML`            | LOB or Data Page       | Depends on size and DB engine                       |
| Primary Key values       | Index Page (Clustered) | In clustered index, full row is here                |
| Secondary Index          | Index Page             | Contains key + pointer to primary key               |
| Old values (Rollback)    | Undo Page              | Used during transaction rollback                    |
| Crash recovery logs      | Redo Page (WAL)        | Replayed if crash happens                           |

# Flow Example: UPDATE a Row

```sql
UPDATE users SET age = 30 WHERE id = 1;
```
Page Usage:

1. Data Page:

- Original row is located and updated (age = 30)

2. Undo Page:

- Old value age = 23 is saved for rollback

3. Redo Page (WAL):

- Log entry recorded: "Row id=1 changed to age=30"

4. Index Page (if any):

- If age is indexed, update the index entry too

5. LOB Page (if row has large TEXT/BLOB):

- If update affects LOB, it updates the LOB page as well

---

All database engines use the same page types, sizes, or storage strategies ‚Äî but the concept of pages is common to all major database engines. Here's how they differ and overlap:

### What‚Äôs Common Across All Engines?

- Page-Based Storage: All major RDBMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server) use pages as the unit of I/O.

- Fixed Page Size: Pages are fixed size (e.g., 8KB), and data is read/written page-by-page, not row-by-row.

- Page Types: All engines have:

  - Data pages

  - Index pages

  - LOB pages (for large data)

  - Undo/Redo/Log pages

### What Differs Between Engines?

| Engine           | Default Page Size | Special Features                            | Notes                                           |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **PostgreSQL**   | 8 KB              | Uses **TOAST** for large values             | Stores oversized rows in separate pages       |
| **MySQL (InnoDB)**| 16 KB            | Has **undo, redo logs**, **compressed pages**| Uses clustered indexes for PK                  |
| **Oracle**       | 2 KB ‚Äì 32 KB      | Advanced **tablespaces, row chaining**      | Many configurable page/block sizes            |
| **SQL Server**   | 8 KB              | Uses **IAM pages, allocation maps**         | Tracks which pages belong to which object     |
| **SQLite**       | 1 KB ‚Äì 64 KB      | Uses **B-tree pages** even for data         | Embedded engine; simple structure             |
