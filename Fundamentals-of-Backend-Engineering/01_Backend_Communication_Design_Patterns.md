# Request-Response

- **What it is**: Client sends a request, server sends back a response.
- **Example**: You open a weather app and ask for the current temperature. The server responds with “32°C”.

# Synchronous vs Asynchronous Workloads

- Synchronous: Waits for the response before doing anything else.
- Asynchronous: Sends the request and moves on without waiting.

- Example:

  - Synchronous: You call a friend and wait until they finish speaking before replying. 
  - Asynchronous: You send a text and do other work while waiting for their reply.

# Push

- **What it is**: Server sends data to the client when it's available.
- **Example**: You get a WhatsApp message instantly — you didn’t ask, but it got “pushed” to you.
